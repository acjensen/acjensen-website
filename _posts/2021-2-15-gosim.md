title: Simulating continuous dynamical systems in Go 
---

In my last post, I simulated a discrete [Linenmayer System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system). L-systems evolve by repeatedly applying a transformation that is a function of the current state. *Continuous* [dynamical systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_systems_theory) also evolve over time according to a function of the current state, but they are described with differential equations rather than a discrete transformation function.

For example, consider a pendulum subject to gravity. The pendulum's governing equation is:

$$ \ddot{\theta} + \frac{-g}{L}\theta = 0 $$

where:

$$ \theta = \text{Pendulum angle [rad]} $$

$$ L = \text{Pendulum length [m]} $$

$$ g = \text{Acceleration of gravity [m/s^2]} $$

We can break the second order differential equation into two first-order differential equations by defining $$s_1 = \theta$$ and $$s_2 = \dot{\theta}$$.

$$s = 
\begin{bmatrix}
s_1\\
s_2
\end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\theta\\
\dot{\theta} 
\end{bmatrix}$$

We can then find how the state $$s$$ evolves over time by finding its derivate $$\dot{s}$$.

$$\dot{s} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\dot{s}_1\\
\dot{s}_2
\end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\dot{\theta}\\
\ddot{\theta} 
\end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\dot{\theta}\\
\frac{-g}{L}\sin{\theta}
\end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
s_2\\
\frac{-g}{L}\sin{s_1}
\end{bmatrix}$$

I defined a `Pendulum` struct to index constant parameters like gravity and pendulum length, and a function `Derivative` that describes how the pendulum's state changes over time. I've also added air friction `f` to make things interesting.

```go
// Pendulum constants.
type Pendulum struct {
	g float64    // Gravity [m/s^2]
	l float64    // Length of pendulum [m]
	f float64    // Air friction coefficient [1]
}

// Pendulum derivative function.
func (p Pendulum) Derivative(s State) State {
	s_new := make(State, len(s))
	s_new[0] = s[1]
	s_new[1] = -p.g/p.l*math.Sin(s[0]) - p.f*s[1]
	return s_new
}
```

Now that we've defined the `Derivative` for our plant system `Pendulum`, we need some way to repeatedly apply the derivative function to mutate the pendulum's state over time.

A simple appoach is to use [Euler's Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method). However, Euler's method can accumulate large error, especially if the time step is too large. Instead, I've implemented one of the higher order methods: a 4th order [Runge Kutta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods).

In the end, I ended up with this neat little API to define and simulate your own plant systems. To simulate a plant system, you simply choose an `integrator`, an initial state `state0`, the time specification `ts`, and the `plant` system.
```go
my_sim := Simulation{
	integrator: RungeKutta4{},
	state0:     State{0, .0001},
	ts:         TimeSpec{num_steps: 100000, t_end: 100},
	plant:      Pendulum{g: 9.81, l: 1.0, m: 1, f: .1, r: Controlled{}},
}

times, states := my_sim.simulate()
```

# Conclusion

I want to continue building out this little simulation library such that users can connect different plants and controllers to simulate larger systems. [Go](https://golang.org/) seems well suited to the task with its [Structural Subtyping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_type_system) and [Interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_(computing)) as first-class language constructs. [Julia](https://julialang.org/) may also prove useful for further study.
